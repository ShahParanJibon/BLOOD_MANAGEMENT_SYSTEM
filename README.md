# Project title
Blood Bank Management System
# Project Description
The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the operations of a blood bank by allowing different users to perform essential tasks. Admins have full control over the system, including managing employees (CRUD operations), overseeing employee actions, and handling overall system configurations. Employees can register and manage donors, patients, and blood inventory, ensuring smooth tracking of donations, transfers, and blood usage. Donors can donate blood, and employees can facilitate the transfer of blood between donors and patients. The system enables users to register, log in, and review their behaviors and interactions within the system. Through role-based access and real-time updates, the system ensures that all blood-related processes are efficiently handled, allowing easy tracking, reporting, and managing of inventory and transactions. With an emphasis on user experience, transparency, and real-time monitoring, BBMS ensures a smooth workflow for all involved in the blood donation and management process.
